the project is to predict restaurant ratings accurately using machine learning algorithms and evaluate their performance with appropriate metrics.
# Resturant-rating-pridiction
This project predicts restaurant ratings using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Data is split into training and testing sets. Models include Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressor. Evaluation metrics are MAE, MSE, and RÂ² score. Visualization compares actual vs. predicted ratings to assess model performance.
